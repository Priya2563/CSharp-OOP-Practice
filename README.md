## Topics Covered in This Repository

This repository contains my C# Console Application practice for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

### Practiced Concepts:
- Class and Object
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance (Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical)
- Polymorphism (Method Overloading & Overriding)
- Interfaces
- Constructor & Constructor Chaining
- Copy Constructor
- Delegates
- Events
- Custom EventArgs
- Event Accessors

### Notes:
- Each `.cs` file contains a **separate runnable example**
- Only the main logic file is uploaded to keep the repository **clean and focused**
- These programs were practiced in Console Applications
